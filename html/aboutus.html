            <p>Audrey's List is a labor of love fueled by the passion and connections made by Audrey Borges during 
                the 10 years that she spent working in the field of behavior analysis first as an ABA therapist, then 
                a clinic manager and finally a marketing coordinator. Each role allowed her to explore more of the 
                autism community, and the more she learned, the more she wanted to help. She met many families who 
                were searching for resources for their loved ones with autism, and often she was able to refer someone 
                to an organization or business that could potentially help.</p>
            <p>Inspired by the stories of families that she met, stories of pain and struggle but also of joy and 
                triumph, she decided that the way she could help is by creating a list of local resources and 
                putting them all in one place.</p>
            <p>Now all of the connections that she made, in addition to new resources, are right here on this website.
                We believe that your child can succeed given the right resources, and that's where we come in. We're 
                dedicated to serving the autism community, so we will put our expertise in autism spectrum disorder and 
                market research to work for you. If you don't find what you're looking for, let us know and we will 
                do our best to locate a resource that meets your needs.</p><br><br><br>
