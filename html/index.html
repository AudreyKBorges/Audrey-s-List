                pediatricians to equestrian therapy and more.</p>
                <p>You lead a busy life, so we have done your research for you. This list contains information 
                about professionals or business owners that we know personally or have thoroughly researched.
                We even have a list of support groups because sometimes you may want to talk to people who really 
                "get you." Maybe your kiddo loves computers and wants to be a programmer. We know exactly where to go!</p>
