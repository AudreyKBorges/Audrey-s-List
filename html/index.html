                <p>Does your child have or show signs of autism? If so, Audrey's List can 
                help you find the resources that you need right here in the Houston metro area.
                Are you looking for a particular type of resource or professional? Find everything from 
                pediatricians to equestrian therapy and more.</p>
                <p>You lead a busy life, so we have done your research for you. This list contains information 
                about professionals and or business owners that we know personally or have thoroughly researched.
                We even have a list of support groups because sometimes you may want to talk to people who really 
                "get you." Maybe your kiddo loves computers and wants to be a programmer. We know exactly where to go!</p>
                <p>Whether your loved one with autism is 2 or 32, we can help. We know that
                autism is life-long and the need for support and understanding is important at every stage of life from 
                your child receiving therapy for the first time to joining a social group and everything in between.
                Your story is as unique as your loved one, and the resources you need are too.</p>
